 <p>Whenever I'm not doing work or am at my job, I like to do different things that can keep me occupied during my free time at IIT and even before that. 
Here are some of the ones that I have been doing as of recently.</p>
 
 <h1>Gundam</h1>

	<h2>What is Gundam</h2>
	<p>Mobile Suit Gundam is a tv show and manga franchise that has been running sinc the late 70's to early 80's and has been continuing to go on till this day.
	Since then, there have been numerous other series within the franchise that have told many different stories with different goals, personalities, sometimes even in the same universe. 
	Some range from having historical characters portrayed by chibi sized gundams, others with tournaments and rivalries, while some get into the style of teeling a narrative of war and it's effects on 
	both factions and the civilans as well.</p>
