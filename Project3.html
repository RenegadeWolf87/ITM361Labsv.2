 <p>Whenever I'm not doing work or am at my job, I like to do different things that can keep me occupied during my free time at IIT and even before that. 
Here are some of the ones that I have been doing as of recently.</p>
 
 <h1>Gundam</h1>

	<h2>What is Gundam</h2>
	<p>Mobile Suit Gundam is a anime and manga franchise that has been running sinc the late 70's to early 80's and has been continuing to go on till this day.
	Since then, there have been numerous other series within the franchise that have told many different stories with different goals, personalities, sometimes even in the same universe. 
	Some range from having historical characters portrayed by chibi sized gundams, others with tournaments and rivalries, while some get into the style of teeling a narrative of war and it's effects on 
	both factions and the civilans as well. Some of my favorites from the franchise have been Gundam:Iron Blooded Orphans, Gundam Witch from Mercury, and Gundam Build Fighters and its sequels in the build series</p>

	<h2>Minecraft</h2>
	<p>Minecraft is a sandbox style video game where you can build, interact, and play however you want. It has been used for many different things such as storytelling/roleplay, minigames,
	high profile events, and even become one of the best games with constant updates, balances and even mods and modpacks if you want to get more out of it or wanna tell a different story.
	It has honestly become one of the best games that anyone from any generation can take part in whether it is solo or multiplayer.</p>

 <h2>Yu-Gi-Oh</h2>
 <p>Yu-Gi-Oh is a anime that is centered around a card game where monsters ranging from dragons, magicians, fiends, warriors, and even gods and god-like figures and they will battle it out
 whether it involves a petty squabble or misunderstanding to the fate of peoples lives or even saving the world or universe. The series has also spawned a massive and incredible trading card game that
 has had national and international tournaments for many to compete in and has also been competing with Magic The Gathering and the Pokemon Trading Card Game as well.
 This has been one of the series that is really close to my heart from my childhood. From watching the characters fighting it out in the show and even being able to play this game
 with my friends in elementary/middle school and more so in high school, recreating the duels from TV and even having our own adventures and own stakes involved.</p>
